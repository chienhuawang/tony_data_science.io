### Featured Projects

#### 1. LLM for Multi-Hop Question Answering on Knowledge Graphs
* [cite_start]**Context**: Industrial level training with Coursera and Microsoft, addressing the challenge of existing LLMs struggling with multi-hop question answering grounded in structured knowledge graphs, especially in Chinese-language contexts[cite: 8].
* **Method**:
    * [cite_start]Designed and implemented a Graph-RAG architecture using Llamaindex's `PropertyGraphIndex`, integrated with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo fine-tuning pipeline[cite: 8].
    * [cite_start]Programmatically generated high-quality JSONL training data combining contextual retrieval and manually curated golden responses[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**Results**: Successfully fine-tuned an LLM capable of precise knowledge graph reasoning and context-aware responses, significantly improving answer accuracy and interpretability for both Chinese and multilingual RAG systems[cite: 8].
* **Tech Stack**: `LLM Fine-Tuning`, `Graph-RAG`, `Llamaindex`, `Knowledge Graph`, `GPT-3.5-turbo`, `Python`

#### 2. Marketing Promotion Strategy A/B Testing (Starbucks)
* [cite_start]**Context**: Supported the design of an $A/B$ testing blueprint to launch a customized personal promotion strategy for Starbucks[cite: 8].
* **Method**:
    * [cite_start]Leveraged KPIs such as Participation Rate, Average Spending, and Conversion Rate[cite: 8].
    * [cite_start]Designed a Python application for the decision-making process and applied the Chi-square test and a PSM-Hierarchical-Bayesian-DID method to validate statistical significance[cite: 8].
* **Results**:
    * [cite_start]**Increased the overall promotion participation rate by around 20%**[cite: 8].
    * [cite_start]**Increased the conversion rate by around 12%**[cite: 8].
* **Tech Stack**: `$A/B$ Testing`, `Statistical Validation`, `Chi-square Test`, `Bayesian Methods`, `Python`

#### 3. Customer Demand Forecast and Intelligent Recommendation (Starbucks)
* [cite_start]**Context**: Developed an internal core driver to simulate store demand, optimizing labor costs while maximizing profits[cite: 8].
* **Method**:
    * [cite_start]Utilized the Facebook Prophet algorithm API for simulation and optimized backend logic with PySpark[cite: 8].
    * [cite_start]Predicted demand by 15-minute intervals across different channels and items[cite: 8].
* **Results**:
    * [cite_start]**Achieved an accuracy rate of 85%-95%** for 10,000 to 20,000 stores[cite: 8].
    * [cite_start]**Reduced labor costs by 5%-10%** and **increased profits by 2%-5%**[cite: 8].
* **Tech Stack**: `Time Series Forecasting`, `Facebook Prophet`, `PySpark`, `Optimization`

#### 4. Unsupervised Machine Learning for Chronic Kidney Disease Diagnosis (Amgen)
* [cite_start]**Context**: Automated patient classification to enable more accurate treatment plans at Amgen[cite: 8].
* **Method**:
    * [cite_start]Performed feature selection using tree-based models and improved computing time with PCA[cite: 8].
    * [cite_start]Classified groups using the Gaussian Mixture algorithm, embedding new labels for accurate patient treatment[cite: 8].
* **Results**:
    * [cite_start]**Achieved a classification accuracy of around 98%**[cite: 8].
    * [cite_start]**Reduced labor costs and optimized diagnosis processes by 10%-15%**[cite: 8].
* **Tech Stack**: `Unsupervised Learning`, `Gaussian Mixture Model`, `PCA`, `Tree-based Models`
